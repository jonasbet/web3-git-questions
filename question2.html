<h1>Compare CLI VS. GUI clients for working with Git</h1>

<h3>Control</h3>
<p>
    Once one gets familiar with the commands available and their attributes the control one
    exerts could not be compared with the limited possibilities of a Gui Interface.
</p>

<h3>Ease</h3>
<p>
    New users seem to feel more ease in a visual environment. New concepts deployed by
    commands could scare newbies. Just after getting the head around about their features
    giving a try to the command line should not be that impressive.
</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>
    Provided typing is not an issue, as the user know exactly what his needs are and how to translate them into
    possible just one line the speed boots.
