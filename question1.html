<h1>Question 1: Argue 2 advantages of Git DVCS over Dropbox</h1>
<h3>Files or project</h3>
<p>
    Suppose you try something that changes many files, but then decide you don’t like
    it and want to roll back to how you had it before. In Dropbox, you find each file and
    restore the previous version. Did you get them all? Are you sure they’re all restored
    to the versions that match each other? With git, I double click on a version and poof,
    the whole project is back to the way it was three weeks ago. Double click again, and instantly
    everything is restored back to the present. (You can also restore individual files, of course.)
</p>

<h3>Tinkering allowed</h3>
<p>
    Let’s say you have a great idea for improving the project: maybe you’re going to edit & reorganize
    a bunch of code files. But while you’re working on it, the half-finished version is going to break
    everything for everyone. In Dropbox, you could turn off syncing… but what if you want to spread your
    work over a few days? While your collaborators work, you can’t keep up with their changes over those days.
    You could copy the code and edit in a separate folder, but what if other people are changing the main code
    while you’re at it? How are you going to combine your changes with theirs and be sure you’ve done it right?
