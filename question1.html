<h1>Question 1: Argue 2 advantages of Git DVCS over Dropbox</h1>
<h3>Files or project</h3>
<p>
    The philosophy of saving work in Git could be seen as "a moment in time" principle.
    Or at least, that is how I like to call it. All files that belong to a project are
    saved at "a moment in time". When the command commit is executed we determine a point
    in time at which we can get back to where we were.
</p>

<h3>Tinkering allowed</h3>
<p>
    Let’s say you have a great idea for improving the project: maybe you’re going to edit & reorganize
    a bunch of code files. But while you’re working on it, the half-finished version is going to break
    everything for everyone. In Dropbox, you could turn off syncing… but what if you want to spread your
    work over a few days? While your collaborators work, you can’t keep up with their changes over those days.
    You could copy the code and edit in a separate folder, but what if other people are changing the main code
    while you’re at it? How are you going to combine your changes with theirs and be sure you’ve done it right?
