<h1>Question 1: Argue 2 advantages of Git DVCS over Dropbox</h1>
<h3>Files vs project</h3>
<p>
    The philosophy of saving work in Git could be seen as "a moment in time" principle.
    Or at least, that is how I like to call it. All files that belong to a project are
    saved at "a moment in time". When the command commit is executed we determine a point
    in time at which we can get back to where we were.
</p>

<h3>Allowing Tinkering</h3>
<p>
    I am sure every new coder has felt the pressure to stop developing a certain project
    once it is working at an acceptable level. The fear of making the project worse or even
    breaking it completing could become paralysing. But, what if the new coder has used the
    advantages of the "moment in time"?. The previous point gives us a reason not to be
    fearful.
